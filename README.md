# Parallel Programming in Python
This repo has some basic examples and resource if anyone is looking for 
the topic of Parallel Programming in Python;  
I used several realiable online sources and few well authored books published by Packt Publishing.

# Below are some great tutorial 

1. [This notebook](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter13.00-Parallel-Your-Python.html) contains an excerpt from The Python Programming and Numerical Methods - A Guide for Engineers and Scientists, the content is also available at Berkeley Python Numerical Methods.
